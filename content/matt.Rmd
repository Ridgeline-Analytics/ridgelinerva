## Bio

After 10+ years working in public relations / government services, I moved into 
data science after realizing I preferred working with data to summarizing it. I 
like working with clients to improve their workflow and provide insights 
into their business.

I largely work in R and Python, but dabble with some front end development such
as HTML and CSS. Secretly, I also enjoy using Excel.
