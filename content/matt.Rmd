## Bio

After 10+ years working in public relations / government services, I moved into 
data science. I really enjoy working with data to find and deliver insights, 
solve business problems, and build tools that help people work more efficiently. 

I largely work in R and Python, but dabble with some front end development like
HTML and CSS. Secretly, I also enjoy using Excel.
