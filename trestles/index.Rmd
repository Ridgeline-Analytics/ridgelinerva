## Who we are

We are a small analytics and data science firm based out of Richmond, VA. But let's be honest, we are serious nerds. Serious nerds who want to help you reach your data science potential.

## What we do

We are data scientists! We believe in the cross-disciplinary approach, meaning we have learned a lot about a lot of different things! This makes us great for helping companies who aren't quite ready to hire data scientists full-time break in to the field.

## How to get started

Click the button to the left and send us an email. We will get back to you within 24 hours. At that point, we can set up a quick video call and figure out the best steps forward.
